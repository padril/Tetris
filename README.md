# Batch Tetris

> **WARNING**

Batch is an incredibly frustrating and time-consuming project to build anything in, and I no longer
have the mental bandwidth to work on this. That being said, there are some good ideas and chunks of
code in this project that could be reusable, and it might be valuable to someone.

## What is it?
Batch Tetris is a simple implementation of Tetris in the Windows batch scripting language (`.bat` or `.cmd`).

## Usage
Download `tetris.cmd` (you can read over the code to make sure it doesn't do anything untoward to your
computer, but seriously it's just Tetris) and run it by typing `./tetris.cmd` into a command prompt
open to the same folder as `tetris.cmd`. Requires an ANSI-capable command prompt implementation.
